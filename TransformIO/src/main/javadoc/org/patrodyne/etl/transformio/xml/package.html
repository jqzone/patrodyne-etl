		<p>
			The batch XML binding package contains classes representing the batch configuration.
			These classes marshal batch configuration objects into an XML file and unmarshal a XML
			file back into the runtime batch instance.
		</p>
		<p>
			This package is auto-generated from an XML schema, at build time.

		<p>The core package contains the application launcher and the transformation engine.</p>
		<p>
			The launcher limits imports to standard packages to reduce the risk of class loader 
			exceptions. Once activated, the launcher starts the application by transferring control 
			to one of the user interface packages. The launcher catches exceptions for display to 
			the console and/or the desktop.
		</p>
		<p>
			The transformation engine manages the batch (XML) configuration file, the source stream,
			the target stream, transform scripting (JSR 223) and execution of the transform.
